    <h2 class="qq">Chemicals and reagents</h2>
    <p class="w">Alpelisib and enzalutamide, which was used as an internal standard (IS), were purchased from
         MedChemExpress (Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA). High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) grade
          acetonitrile and methanol were purchased from J.T. Baker (Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). Formic acid was
           purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). Ultrapure water, used as a component of the mobile
            phase, was obtained using a Milli-Q water system (Merck Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Heparinized
           blank mouse and human plasma was obtained from Innovative Research, Inc. (Novi, MI, USA), and
          heparinized capillaries were purchased from Kimble Chase Life Science and Research Products,
         LLC (Rockwood, TN, USA). All other reagents were of analytical grade and were used without 
         further purification.</p>
  <h2 class="qq">Instruments</h2>
   <p class="ww">An LC–MS/MS system comprising an Agilent 1260 series HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA)
     and an API 3200 mass spectrometer (AB SCIEX, Framingham, MA, USA) equipped with a turbo electrospray interface
      was used in this study. The mass spectrometer was operated in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode with
       positive electrospray ionization (ESI+) for the quantification of alpelisib and the IS. The optimized
        collision energy voltages were 33 and 35 V for alpelisib and the IS, respectively, and the source
      temperature was set at 550 °C. The most abundant product ions were at m/z 328.0 from the precursor ion
       at m/z 442.1 for alpelisib, and at m/z 209.1 from the precursor ion at m/z 465.0 for the IS. Chromatographic
        resolution of alpelisib and the IS was performed using a reversed-phase HPLC column
         (XTerra MS C18, 50 mm × 2.1 mm, 5 µm; Waters Corporation, Milford, MA, USA) with a linear gradient
          of 0.1% formic acid in water and 0.1% formic acid acetonitrile (90%:10% → 5%:95%, v/v) at a flow rate
           of 0.4 mL/min for 5 min. The autosampler temperature was set at 10 °C. Instrument control and data
         analysis were performed using Analyst software version 1.5.2 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).</p>
         <h2 class="qq">Sample preparation</h2>
         <p class="e">A 20 µL aliquot of mouse or human plasma sample was added to 80 µL of acetonitrile containing
             300 ng/mL of the IS to induce the precipitation of plasma proteins. After vortexing for 10 min,
              the mixture was centrifuged at 13,500×g for 10 min at 4 °C. The supernatant was transferred to
               a 96-well sample plate, and 10 μL was injected into the LC–MS/MS system.</p>
