        <p class="test1">Known in recent years for its sculptural, surrealist designs -- remember the "ready-made"
            sandal series from Spring-Summer 2022 that featured cracked eggs, nail polish bottles and
             rose stems in place of traditional stiletto heels? -- the brand has long been inspired
              by nature. During this season's menswear shows, Anderson grew chia and grass on the surface 
              of sneakers, pea coats, hoodies and tracksuit bottoms in a collaboration with Spanish
               bio-designer Paula Ulargui Escalona. The painstaking process required the garments to
                be kept in a poly-tunnel prior to the event, where they were watered regularly until
                 worn by the models. Loewe also offers a florist service, with a physical store in Madrid
                  called "LOEWE FLORES" selling artfully arranged bouquets.</p>
