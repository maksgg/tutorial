    <p><strong>1</strong>Known in recent years for its sculptural, surrealist designs -- remember the "ready-made" sandal series from
        Spring-Summer 2022 that featured cracked eggs, nail polish bottles and rose stems in place of traditional
         stiletto heels? -- the brand has long been inspired by nature. During this season's menswear shows, Anderson
          grew chia and grass on the surface of sneakers, pea coats, hoodies and tracksuit bottoms in a collaboration
           with Spanish bio-designer Paula Ulargui Escalona. The painstaking process required the garments to be kept
            in a poly-tunnel prior to the event, where they were watered regularly until worn by the models. Loewe also
             offers a florist service, with a physical store in Madrid called "LOEWE FLORES" selling artfully arranged
              bouquets.</p>
